# COVID-19-DETECTION


This project explores the COVID-19 pandemic using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The following algorithms and methodologies were employed to ensure a comprehensive understanding and accurate predictions:

#### **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
- **Dataset Handling**: The raw COVID-19 dataset was preprocessed by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values.
- **Standard Scaling**: Numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to optimize the performance of machine learning algorithms.

#### **Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis**
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries were used for static visualizations to understand trends in COVID-19 cases and fatalities.
- **Plotly**: Interactive plots were created using Plotly Express and Graph Objects to visualize geographic and temporal distributions dynamically.

#### **Statistical Analysis**
- **ADF Test**: The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test was employed to check for stationarity in the time series data, a prerequisite for advanced time series models.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Measures such as mean, variance, and correlation were calculated to understand the relationships between variables.

#### **Predictive Modeling**
- **Linear Regression**: Implemented for baseline predictive modeling, including Ridge and Lasso variants for regularization.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Utilized for capturing non-linear trends in the dataset.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Applied for robust predictions on smaller, complex datasets.
- **GridSearchCV**: Hyperparameter optimization was performed using GridSearchCV to fine-tune machine learning models.

#### **Time Series Forecasting**
- **Exponential Smoothing Methods**:
  - Simple Exponential Smoothing: Used for short-term forecasts with less variability.
  - Holt’s Linear Method: Captures trends in the data over time.
  - Exponential Smoothing with Seasonality: Accounts for both trend and seasonal variations.
- **ARIMA Modeling**:
  - Auto ARIMA from the `pmdarima` library was employed for automated hyperparameter selection and modeling of non-seasonal and seasonal ARIMA models.

#### **Model Evaluation**
- **Performance Metrics**: Models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values.
- **Silhouette Analysis**: For clustering or grouping data, silhouette scores and samples were analyzed to measure cluster coherence.

#### **Tools and Libraries**
- **Statsmodels**: Used extensively for statistical tests and time series analysis.
- **Sklearn**: Provided a robust framework for machine learning modeling and preprocessing.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: Fundamental for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.

This project provides a thorough exploration of predictive modeling and statistical insights into the COVID-19 pandemic, combining data science techniques with intuitive visualizations to enhance interpretability.

This project analyzes COVID-19 data using a range of statistical and machine learning techniques. Key algorithms include Linear Regression (with Ridge and Lasso regularization), Polynomial Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predictive modeling. Time series forecasting utilized Exponential Smoothing methods, including Holt’s Linear Model and Seasonal Exponential Smoothing, alongside ARIMA models optimized with Auto ARIMA. Data preprocessing involved scaling with StandardScaler, and stationarity checks used the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test. Model evaluation employed metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, while hyperparameter tuning was conducted via GridSearchCV. Tools like Statsmodels, Sklearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly supported statistical analysis and visualization, offering deep insights into the dataset.
